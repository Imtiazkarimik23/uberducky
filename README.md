# Uberducky - Wireless USB Rubber Ducky built on Ubertooth

## What is a USB Rubber Ducky?

A [USB Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe) is
social engineering tool that impersonates a keyboard and can inject keystrokes
into an unlocked computer. It is often used to gain a foothold inside a network
environment or target an individual with otherwise good security hygiene.

## Why Wireless?

Sometimes it's not feasible to wait for your target to leave their computer
unlocked. If their system has a hidden USB port (such as behind a screen or
under a desk) you can plug in Uberducky and lay in wait. When the opportunity
arises, distract the victim and launch the attack wirelessly.

## Why Ubertooth?

Ubertooth is a great piece of kit, and best of all the design is completely
open. The LPC1752 microcontroller has a flexible USB peripheral that can
emulate a keyboard, and the CC2400 radio facilitates easy communication over
2.4 GHz ISM.
